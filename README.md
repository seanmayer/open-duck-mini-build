# open-duck-mini-build

Building an open-source humanoid robot while exploring robotics, embedded systems, and AI.

This repository is my build journal for the Open Duck Mini v2: sourcing parts, printing and assembling the robot, documenting calibration, and eventually experimenting with the software stack.

## Attribution

Open Duck Mini is an open-source robotics project by the original project maintainers at [apirrone/Open_Duck_Mini](https://github.com/apirrone/Open_Duck_Mini). This repository is not a fork of the upstream project and does not duplicate the upstream source files. It is a personal build log, workshop notes, shopping tracker, and place for my own modifications or scripts as the build progresses.

## Current Status

Phase 1 workshop setup is complete enough to move forward. The build is now past printing and into fit checks plus hardware sourcing.

Printed so far: all required STL prints and optional TPU foot bottoms are complete. The PLA feet have been dry-fitted, and the TPU foot bottoms are ready for final fit checks.

Hardware sourcing has started: the foot micro switches, battery charger, and 18650 cells have arrived, with the main robot electronics, servos, and remaining power hardware being tracked as they arrive.

The next milestone is final fit checks, heat-set insert prep, and hardware/electronics preparation as parts arrive.

## Project Progress

Updated: 2026-08-19

Progress is tracked as a practical build estimate rather than an exact percentage. Printing progress is counted from the required printed part quantities in [docs/printing-progress.md](docs/printing-progress.md). The optional TPU foot bottoms are complete as an upgrade to the PLA feet.

Overall build progress   [#####-----] 48%
Printing progress        [##########] 100%  49 / 49 required printed parts + TPU feet
```

| Area | Progress | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Workshop setup | 100% | Core tools, soldering setup, fasteners, inserts, wire, and consumables are ready. |
| 3D printing and fit checks | 100% | All required STL prints and optional TPU foot bottoms are complete. PLA feet have been dry-fitted. |
| Hardware sourcing | 20% | Foot micro switches, 18650 cells, and charger received; servos, controller, Raspberry Pi, IMU, power protection/regulation parts, and sensors are being tracked. |
| Mechanical assembly | 5% | Early dry fitting has started; final assembly waits on servos, switches, and remaining hardware. |
| Electronics and power | 0% | Not started. |
| Calibration and first motion | 0% | Not started. |
| Software and runtime experiments | 0% | Not started. |

Current next step: fit the TPU bottoms to the PLA feet, test-fit the foot micro switches, check the 18650 cell voltages, and keep the batteries aside until the power protection/regulation path is confirmed.

Progress notes: update this section whenever printing, sourcing, assembly, electronics, calibration, or software progress changes.

## Principles

- Keep attribution clear and link back to the upstream project.
- Document the build process honestly, including mistakes and fixes.
- Avoid copying upstream files unless I am intentionally modifying or extending them.
- Keep purchases phased so the project stays manageable.
- Prefer small, useful commits that show the engineering journey.
